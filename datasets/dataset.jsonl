In this system the voter having one identity can vote only once, because the voter's identity gets locked after casting the vote. RFID readers read the data of voter's identity when it enters the RFID reader area and then the voter can cast his vote. By using of RFID reader, it will avoid invalid voting. In this case these systems are claimed to be secure based on the assumption that readers and tags need to be in close proximity 7cm in order to communicate.{new_line}This project presents the way to develop an RFID based voting machine which displays the count of votes on a 16x2 LCD interface. A user can get his or her vote through a set of switches, by first identifying the card using RFID tag reader. After every cast of votes, the subsequent count can be seen on LCD or we can display result on computer instantly when the voting get over. The circuit uses8051micro -  controller code for the project using embedded C language.{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}Current Company Job Profile{new_line}Company Name : Wipro limited.{new_line}Address : Phase 2, Pune Infotech Park, Midc,{new_line}Hinjewadi, Pune, Maharashtra 411027.{new_line}Office Contact No.  : 020 - 22933700{new_line}Position : Senior Process Lead{new_line}Joining Date : 15th Dec 2020{new_line}Current Status : Currently Working{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}Currently On -  Project in Wipro Detail as listed below:{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}SD - WAN Cisco Meraki Cloud & LAN Implementation{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}Client Name : British Telecommunications (BT Group){new_line}Working Period : Working from Dec - 2021{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}Currently working on two major global international projects as IT Process lead implementation engineer{new_line}{new_line}{new_line}1.
